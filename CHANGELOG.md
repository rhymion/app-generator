## [Unreleased]

## [1.1.0] - TBD

### Added
- Default-deny authorization: new users start with zero permissions; Administrators
  must explicitly grant entity-level permissions via the Permission management UI
  or `db:grantAllPermissions` script. Role-based access control is enforced at the
  API layer (`lib/authz.ts`).
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) via TOTP:
  - Time-based one-time password (TOTP) support
  - AES-256-GCM encrypted secret storage
  - 8 recovery codes generated at enrollment, stored as bcrypt hashes
  - Self-service enrollment UI at Settings → Security (`/setting/mfa`)
